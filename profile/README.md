# Welcome to Kodkollektivet i Kalmar! ðŸš€

We're a non-profit student organization founded by students at Linnaeus University in Kalmar. Our mission? Creating an awesome community for coders and developers where everyone can learn and grow together.

<br>

## What We Do

We host weekly coding sessions where we work on all sorts of cool stuff:
- Real projects for local businesses (like websites for Kalmar Atletklubb and DÃ¶dsbotÃ¶mning Kalmar)
- Our own hobby projects (working on our own game and a website for the student organization SPIIK)
- Regular LAN parties and occasional hackathons when were feeling ambitious

<br>

## Projects & Services

Need a website? We've got you covered! When you work with us, you're not just getting a professional website - you're supporting a student organization that promotes tech innovation in Kalmar. We work closely with our clients to understand their needs and create solutions that fit their business perfectly.
